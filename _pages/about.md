I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu) under the direction of [Prof. Philip Protter](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~protter/). My research interests lie primarily in problems in probability, stochastic processes, and statistics motivated by their applications, particularly in mathematical finance and more specifically in credit risk theory. [Here](https://youtu.be/8R5VFvpx6ok) you can see one of my recent talks.

During my Ph.D. program, I held a [Fulbright grant](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), I received the [Howard Levene Outstanding Teaching Award](https://stat.columbia.edu/howard-levene-outstanding-teaching-award/), and I was one of the finalists for the [2021 and 2022 Presidential Awards for Outstanding Teaching](https://provost.columbia.edu/content/presidential-awards-outstanding-teaching) by a Graduate Student at Columbia University. Before graduate school, I had a merit scholarship to major in Actuarial Sciences in [Universidad de las AmÃ©ricas Puebla (UDLAP)](https://www.udlap.mx/web/en/) where I graduated as Summa Cum Laude and was the Valedictorian of my class ([here](https://youtu.be/5GwOKZw3wdo?t=4943) you can see a video of my commencement speech).

I was born and raised in [Puebla, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla_(city)) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and currently live in Madison, WI. I love running! I have run 8 marathons so far and I am currently training for the [2022 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/). Check out these marathons and other races I have [run](/runs/)!
