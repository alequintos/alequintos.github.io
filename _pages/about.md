I am finishing my Ph.D. in Statistics at [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu) under the direction of [Prof. Philip Protter](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~protter/). My research interests lie primarily in problems in probability, stochastic processes, and statistics motivated by their applications, particularly those applications in mathematical finance and more specifically in credit risk theory. My [recent work](/publications/) has focused on the study of dependent stopping times, which has led to a multivariate version of the Cox Process that potentially has applications in several fields, from finance to epidemiology. Based on this multivariate stochastic process, Prof. Philip Protter, [Prof. Robert Jarrow](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/raj15/), and I have proposed a new measure of systemic risk.

During my Ph.D. program, I held a [Fulbright grant](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), and I was one of the finalists for the [2021 Presidential Awards for Outstanding Teaching](https://provost.columbia.edu/content/presidential-awards-outstanding-teaching) by a Graduate Student at Columbia University. Before graduate school, I worked for Citigroup in Mexico, participated in a summer research program at Cornell University, and did an internship in DC. I had a merit scholarship to major in Actuarial Sciences in [Universidad de las AmÃ©ricas Puebla (UDLAP)](https://www.udlap.mx/web/en/) where I graduated as Summa Cum Laude and was the Valedictorian of my class ([here](https://youtu.be/5GwOKZw3wdo?t=4943) you can see a video of my speech).

I was born and raised in [Puebla, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla_(city)) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and currently live in New York ðŸ—½. I love running! I have run 8 marathons so far and just finished the [2021 NYC Marathon](/images/ale-quintos-nyc-marathon-2021.jpeg). Check out these marathons and other races I have [run](/runs/)!

**I am on the academic job market.**
